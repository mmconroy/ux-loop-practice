    Loops Practice - Part One

    Building an Exercise Routine

    You are going to build a program that can help you keep track of your exercise routine.

    Your routine can be represented by an array of each activity.
    let routine = ["situp", "situp", "situp", "situp", "pushup", "pushup", "pushup", "pushup"];

    Use a while loop to complete every exercise.

    Exercise One

    Building a routine

    Given a routine, an exercise, and number of repetitions,
    Add that exercise to your routine for the number of repetitions.

    For example:
    routine = [];
    exercise = "situp";
    numRepetitions = 4;

    You should add four situps to your routine, resulting in a routine like this:
    routine = ["situp", "situp", "situp", "situp"];

    You do not need to return anything, just modify the routine array.

    Exercise Four

    Remove and exercise from your routine


    Now you have an exercise routine, but you don't really like doing some of the 
    exercises in it.

    Complete the function removeExerciseFromRoutine

    Given an exercise, it should remove all instances of that exercise from the routine.

    The function should not return anything, you should modify the existing routine array.

    For example:

    let routine = ["situp", "pushup", "situp", "pushup", "pullup", "pullup", "pushup", "pushup"];
    removeExerciseFromRoutine(routine, "pushup");

    now routine is equal to ["situp", "situp", "pullup", "pullup"];

    Hint: Use the array.splice() method to remove an item from the item.
    https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp

    Hint2: If you remove an element from the array, the length just got shorter!
    What does this mean for your current index? What does that mean for your loop?
    If your code isn't working, make sure to walk through it with
    the debugger to see what's going wrong.
